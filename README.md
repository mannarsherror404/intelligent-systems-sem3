# 🧠 Intelligent Systems I Lab

This repository contains 9 AI lab experiments from the Intelligent Systems I course at NMIMS (Semester III). These labs explore key concepts in artificial intelligence using Python.

> ✅ _All experiments were performed in **Google Colab**. I will be uploading the notebook's **PDF print** and the corresponding **Python `.py` file** for each experiment._

## 📋 Experiments Summary

1. **Exp 1 – Turing Test (Theory Only)**  
   _Summarized Alan Turing’s foundational paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” and the Imitation Game concept._  
   > 📝 _Note: This experiment is theoretical and not implemented in code._

2. **Exp 2 – Water Jug & Missionary-Cannibal Problem**  
   _Solved classic state-space problems using Breadth-First Search in Python._

3. **Exp 3 – Vacuum Cleaner World**  
   _Simulated a simple two-location intelligent agent and analyzed its rationality and PEAS representation._

4. **Exp 4 – Best-First Search**  
   _Implemented heuristic-based pathfinding using the Best-First Search algorithm._

5. **Exp 5 – Prolog Programming**  
   _Defined facts, rules, and queries in Prolog for knowledge representation and inference.[NOTE: Run in suitable environment]_

6. **Exp 6 – A* Search Algorithm**  
   _Solved an informed search problem using A* algorithm and compared it with Best-First Search._

7. **Exp 7 – Minimax Game Algorithm**  
   _Developed a simple two-player adversarial game using the Minimax algorithm._

8. **Exp 8 – Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**  
   _Implemented CSPs like Sudoku and 4-Queens using Python with and without a constraint solver._

9. **Exp 9 – N-Queens with Backtracking**  
   _Used backtracking to solve the N-Queens problem, ensuring no conflicts on the board._
